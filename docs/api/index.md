# PolyKit API

Here you will find source code documentation for PolyKit, similar to what you might find on Microsoft Learn.

This documentation is designed to provide a reference for you when building your own projects.

If you find an error in this documentation, or have an idea about a new article to add, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Tenacom/PolyKit/issues/new/choose).
